    "First-principles QM simulations are very complicated and very expensive. We could \"implement\" such simulations in a short project, but we would have to rely on a large amount of pre-existing software infrastructure. Instead, we will implement a simpler semiempirical QM simulation that contains just enough physics and chemistry to qualitatively describe our target application and uses a handful of model parameters to quantitatively reproduce some key properties of interest. We can then limit our external dependencies to the popular mathematical functionality of Python:"

    "The goal of this project is to simulate potential energy surfaces for clusters of Argon atoms. Argon is a noble gas, thus it doesn't easily form chemical bonds or participate in chemical reactions. Its primary interaction is through the London dispersion interaction, which is mediated by quantum dipole fluctuations of its valence electrons. This interaction will be the focus of our semiempirical model.\n",

    "A lot of energy is required to excite the electrons in the first and second electronic shells, so we can safely ignore them. We will also freeze the 3s electrons to focus on the lowest-energy dipole transition from 3p to a continuum of unbound s orbitals. In our model, we will approximate these electronic degrees of freedom with a fully occupied p shell and an unoccupied s shell, for a total of 4 atomic orbitals per atom.\n",

In first-principles calculations, each element of $h_{p,q}$ and $V_{p,q,r,s}$ would require the evaluation of a complicated integral. In our semiempirical model, we will set most of them to zero and assign a simple form to the rest of them. Also, we will assume that the atomic orbitals are orthogonal to avoid an orthogonalization step.
