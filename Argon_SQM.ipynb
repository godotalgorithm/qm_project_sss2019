    "In this project, we will simulate a cluster of Argon atoms using quantum mechanics (QM) to calculate their total energy. First-principles QM simulations are complicated and expensive, and a quick implementation would rely on a substantial amount of pre-existing software infrastructure. Instead, we will implement a much simpler semiempirical QM simulation that has been designed and parameterized to reproduce first-principles QM data using a minimal model. We can then limit our external dependencies to the standard mathematical functionality of Python: NumPy to build and solve matrix and tensor equations and SymPy to compute analytical derivatives as needed:"

    "This semiempirical model will combine some standard concepts and methods used in physics and chemistry. First, it will use a minimal number of electronic degrees of freedom. Because Argon is a noble gas, it interacts primarily through London dispersion forces that are mediated by quantum dipole fluctuations. The lowest energy dipole transition is from the occupied $3p$ states to the unoccupied $4s$ state, and we will include these 4 atomic orbitals per atom. Similarly, we will use a multipole expansion to simplify electronic excitations and retain only the monopole and dipole terms, which also restricts electronic polarization to 4 degrees of freedom per atom. We will use $\\{s, p_x, p_y, p_z\\}$ to label both sets of basis functions on each atom."

In our semiempirical model, we will set most of them to zero and assign a simple analytical form to the rest of them.

    "To define $V_{p,q,r,s}$ based on the Coulomb matrix elements $V_{p,q}^{\\mathrm{ee}}$, we need to define a mapping from products of atomic orbitals to a linear combination of terms in the multipole expansion of electronic charge. Because the atomic orbitals are normalized, their monopole coefficient with themselves is 1 (i.e. they have unit charge). Because of orthogonality, there is no monopole term for either intra-atomic or inter-atomic transitions between atomic orbitals. We will ignore dipole transitions between atoms, which corresponds to the [neglect of diatomic differential overlap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDDO) (NDDO) approximation that is commonly used in semiempirical quantum chemistry. All that remains is the intra-atomic s-p transition, and we will use the final parameter of the model, $\\alpha$, to define its dipole strength. These transformation rules are all contained in a tensor\n",

The standard and localized calculations are distinct approximations with very different costs, and they should be independently accessible with a similar interface.\n",
