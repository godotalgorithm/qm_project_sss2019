    "\n",
    "In this project, we will simulate a cluster of Argon atoms using quantum mechanics (QM) to calculate their total energy. First-principles QM simulations are complicated and expensive, and a quick implementation would rely on a substantial amount of pre-existing software infrastructure. Instead, we will implement a much simpler semiempirical QM simulation that has been designed and parameterized to reproduce first-principles QM data using a minimal model. We can then limit our external dependencies to the standard mathematical functionality of Python: NumPy to build and solve matrix and tensor equations and SymPy to compute analytical derivatives as needed:"

    "This semiempirical model will combine some standard concepts and methods used in physics and chemistry. First, it will use a minimal number of electronic degrees of freedom. Because Argon is a noble gas, it interacts primarily through London dispersion forces that are mediated by quantum dipole fluctuations. The lowest energy dipole transition is from the occupied $3p$ states to the unoccupied $4s$ state, and we will include these 4 atomic orbitals per atom. Similarly, we will use a multipole expansion to simplify electronic excitations and retain only the monopole and dipole terms, which also restricts electronic polarization to 4 degrees of freedom per atom. We will use $\\{s, p_x, p_y, p_z\\}$ to label both sets of basis functions on each atom."

In our semiempirical model, we will set most of them to zero and assign a simple analytical form to the rest of them. We will also assume that the atomic orbitals are all orthogonal, which avoids having to deal with overlap matrices. The notation being used here is mostly consistent with modern quantum chemistry notation, but some objects, particularly $V_{p,q,r,s}$, have multiple conventions in practice.\n",
