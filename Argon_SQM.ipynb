    "First-principles QM simulations are very complicated and very expensive. We could \"implement\" such simulations in a short project, but we would have to rely on a large amount of pre-existing software infrastructure. Instead, we will implement a simpler semiempirical QM simulation that contains just enough physics and chemistry to qualitatively describe our target application and uses a handful of model parameters to quantitatively reproduce some key properties of interest. We can then limit our external dependencies to the popular mathematical functionality of Python:"

    "The goal of this project is to simulate potential energy surfaces for clusters of Argon atoms. Argon is a noble gas, thus it doesn't easily form chemical bonds or participate in chemical reactions. Its primary interaction is through the London dispersion interaction, which is mediated by quantum dipole fluctuations of its valence electrons. This will be the focus of our semiempirical model.\n",
