# 2019 Software Summer School - QM Sample Repo
A sample repo for the software summer school project.

The initial instruction session for this project will guide students through an implementation in a Jupyter notebook, starting from Argon_SQM0.ipynb and ending with Argon_SQM.ipynb . The software will then be further developed on successive days as documented in their respective directories.
